## Overview
This work investigates how Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can improve the interpretability of deep learning models for sleep apnea detection from biosignal data.

A 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) was trained using biosignals from the *Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS)* dataset provided by the **National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR)**.  
Four XAI methods were implemented and evaluated:

- Grad-CAM  
- LIME  
- Deep SHAP  
- Integrated Gradients  

Each method was compared regarding **faithfulness**, **sparsity**, and **runtime**.
